If you are curious about the real story behind Hachiko dog movie dual audio english to hindi 80 16, here are some facts that you may not know:
  
- Hachiko's real name was Hachi, which means "eight" in Japanese. He was named after the number of his birth order among his siblings. The "ko" suffix was added later as a term of affection.
- Hachiko was a purebred Akita dog, a breed that originated from Odate City in Akita Prefecture. Odate City is proud of being Hachiko's hometown and has many statues and monuments dedicated to him and his breed.
- Hachiko's owner was Hidesaburo Ueno, a professor of agricultural engineering at the University of Tokyo. He adopted Hachiko as a puppy in 1924 and brought him to his home in Shibuya.
- Hachiko accompanied Ueno to Shibuya Station every morning and waited for him to return every evening. This routine lasted until May 21, 1925, when Ueno suffered a cerebral hemorrhage and died at work.
- After Ueno's death, Hachiko was taken care of by different relatives and friends, but he always escaped and returned to Shibuya Station to wait for his master. He did this for almost 10 years, until his own death on March 8, 1935.
- Hachiko's story became widely known in 1932, when a newspaper article about his loyalty was published by Hirokichi Saito, one of Ueno's former students and a well-known dog expert. The article touched the hearts of many people and made Hachiko a national symbol of fidelity.
- Hachiko attracted many visitors and admirers at Shibuya Station, who fed him and took photos with him. He also received gifts and letters from all over Japan and abroad.
- In 1934, a bronze statue of Hachiko was erected in front of Shibuya Station, with Ueno's permission. The statue was sculpted by Teru Ando, who used Hachiko as a model. The statue was unveiled on April 21, 1934, with Hachiko himself present at the ceremony.
- During World War II, the statue was melted down for metal. In 1948, a new statue was made by Takeshi Ando, the son of Teru Ando. The new statue is still standing at Shibuya Station today and is a popular meeting spot for locals and tourists.
- In 1987, the original Japanese film Hachik√Ö¬ç Monogatari (Hachiko Story) was released, directed by Seijiro Koyama and starring Tatsuya Nakadai as Ueno and Kaoru Yachigusa as his wife. The film was a box office hit and won several awards.
- In 2009, the American remake Hachi: A Dog's Tale was released, directed by Lasse Hallstr√É¬∂m and starring Richard Gere as Parker Wilson (based on Ueno) and Joan Allen as his wife Cate. The film was also well-received by critics and audiences.
- Both films were based on the real story of Hachiko, but with some artistic changes and adaptations. For example, in the American film, Parker Wilson is a music professor instead of an agricultural engineer, and he dies of a heart attack instead of a stroke.
- Hachiko's remains were preserved by taxidermy and are displayed at the National Science Museum of Japan in Ueno Park. His fur is brown and white, unlike the black and white color of his statue.
- In 2015, another statue of Hachiko was erected at the University of Tokyo's campus, depicting him being reunited with Ueno. The statue was based on a photo of them together taken in 1925.
- Hachiko has inspired many other works of art and literature, such as books, poems, songs, comics, anime, video games, and TV shows. He has also been featured on stamps, coins, medals, and merchandise.
- Hachiko's legacy lives on in Japan and around the world. Every year on April 8 (Hachiko's birthday) and March 8 (Hachiko's death anniversary), ceremonies are held at Shibuya Station and the University of Tokyo to honor his memory and 8cf37b1e13
